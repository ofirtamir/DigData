# Generate Parenthesis & Media Items Database Project

This project contains solutions for creating, managing, and interacting with a database of media items using MSSQL and Python. The implementation is divided into two main parts: SQL commands and Python functions. The SQL commands handle table creation, triggers, and stored procedures, while the Python functions provide a programmatic interface to interact with the database.
